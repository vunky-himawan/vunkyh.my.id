## What's This Project About?

It’s called the **RT Management System**, a _kolplay_ (read: group work) project for a 4th-semester college assignment. The wild mission? Drag my friend’s neighborhood (_RT_) into the digital age! Imagine going from thick paper records to a system that handles citizen data and decisions the smart way. With my team, I went all-in developing a web application that’s not only functional but (allegedly) minimalist in vibe!

## The Tech Stack (a.k.a. Our Cool Gear)

We didn’t mess around—here’s our arsenal:

- **Laravel 10**: PHP framework that makes our backend lightning-fast.

- **MySQL**: Stores all the RT’s (legal) secrets.

- **Alpine.js + TailwindCSS**: Lightweight and sleek frontend for smooth user experience.

- **Figma**: I personally designed the UI—even though the lecturer called it “too plain” (I say **minimalist**, okay?).

- **CKEditor**: Lets users write announcements in style, including adding images.

- **LaTeX**: For showing formulas in the Decision Support System (DSS), making it look brainy.

## Drama Moments

This project wasn’t all smooth sailing. Top headache? **CKEditor**! I wanted users to upload images in announcements and save them to storage. But when they delete the image from the post… the file stays in storage. Still an open issue, but it’s on the (very long) to-do list.

Second headache? Implementing the **Decision Support System** (SPK)! Making logic for RT decision-making fried my brain. Plus, I used LaTeX to display formulas just to look fancy. After lots of Googling and caffeine, we got it done.

## Show-Off Moment

I’m proud of everything, honestly! But if I had to choose—**my UI design in Figma** is my favorite. I’m not a design wizard, but the landing page looks sleek and minimalist to me. The lecturer said “too plain,” but I call it art. Also, our DSS feature was pretty cool—it gives the RT smart decision-making like something out of a sci-fi movie, but for the village!

## Who Saw It?

This project had a solid audience: classmates, supervising lecturers, and even the head of my friend’s RT. The plan? It’s going to be actually used in that RT to go digital. Imagine the RT head saying:

> “Wow, we can manage the neighborhood from a phone now—no more thick books!”

My classmates just said,

> “Cool, Vunky! Share the code!”
> (Nope, I didn’t, lol.)

Nonono this is a joke, because my classmates is better than me hahahaaaa.

## The Trophy I Got

The biggest win? GPA that’s decent enough to make both my wallet (and my heart) smile! The lecturer gave us good grades, and I learned tons—about Laravel, SPK logic, and even UI design. Not to mention, the teamwork was priceless—**plus bonus cwimie (noodles) on the side!**

## Fun Story Time

The most epic moment? When we went to my friend’s house to interview his dad—the RT head. I showed up with a laptop, asked a bunch of system-related questions, and… they served me delicious cwimie! That bowl of noodles boosted my coding energy by 1000%.
Moral of the story: If you want smooth projects, pick clients who feed you, lol.

## Showing It to the World

We made this project public on GitHub so the world can witness our team’s brilliance (and code that sometimes confuses even us). Check it out:

## Closing Notes

The **RT Management System** was an epic journey—from fiddling with LaTeX to forgetting to clean up images in storage. I learned UI design, built a smart system, and most importantly, chanted “_minimalist, not plain!_” every time the lecturer commented.
This project didn’t just _almost_ bring my friend’s neighborhood into the digital era—it made me laugh, learn, and fill up on cwimie.
What’s next? What could possibly top this?
