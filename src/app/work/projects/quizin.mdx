## About the Project

Quizin is a web-based quiz application I developed to fulfill a technical challenge requirement during an internship application at DOT Indonesia. Although the initial task only focused on frontend development, I decided to challenge myself by building a full-stack application from scratch. The goal of this project was to create an interactive quiz platform that allows users to answer questions, resume unfinished quizzes, and securely manage their sessions through authentication. This project marked a major milestone in my learning journey as a developer.

## Technologies Used

I built this project using modern technologies to support full-stack development:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript, for a fast, responsive, and type-safe user interface.
- **Backend**: Express.js, as the Node.js framework to build efficient APIs.
- **Database**: MySQL + Drizzle ORM, for concise and structured database interaction.
- **Others**: JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication.

## Key Features

Some of the core features I'm especially proud of, particularly since this was my first full-stack project:

- **JWT Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and securely manage sessions with access and refresh tokens.
- **Quiz Progress Storage**: If users exit mid-quiz, they can resume from where they left off using localStorage on the frontend.
- **Custom API**: I designed and built my own API to support communication between the frontend and backend—a big achievement for a first-time full-stack project.

These features demonstrate my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies.

## Challenges

Taking on a full-stack project as a beginner was a bold move—especially since I was only asked to build the frontend. The biggest challenge was understanding authentication, especially the mechanism behind JWT access and refresh tokens. Initially, I was confused about how tokens work and how to manage them on both backend and frontend. However, by studying documentation, tutorials, and experimenting, I successfully implemented a functional authentication system.

Additionally, as this was my first backend-inclusive project, designing an efficient API posed its own challenges. I invested a lot of time learning how Express.js and Drizzle ORM work, but this effort significantly deepened my understanding of full-stack development.

## Impact and Results

Although this project was created for a technical challenge, it had a significant impact. Quizin helped me reach the interview stage at DOT Indonesia on my first try—even though I wasn’t accepted at the time. Two months later, I reapplied for the next internship program and was finally accepted, making this my first internship experience. This project not only helped me pass the selection process but also proved that stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to growth.

## Target Users

Quizin was designed as a demonstration project for a technical challenge, so it doesn’t have real-world users. However, hypothetically, this app could serve students or anyone interested in testing their knowledge through a smooth and interactive quiz experience.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me valuable lessons. My decision to take on full-stack development—despite being asked only for the frontend—taught me the importance of taking risks when learning. A funny moment was when I realized I could have just focused on improving the frontend, but I “recklessly” built a backend from scratch. Failing the first interview also taught me perseverance, which eventually paid off on my second attempt. This project boosted my confidence and opened the door to my first internship experience.

## Project Access

The source code for Quizin is available as a public GitHub repository, allowing anyone to view the implementation and learn from it:

## Closing

Quizin marks a big step in my journey as a developer. From learning JWT authentication to building custom APIs, this project proves that challenges can become opportunities for growth. Though it started as a risky endeavor, my hard work and persistence paid off—leading to my first valuable internship experience. I’m proud of what I’ve achieved and excited to continue exploring the world of full-stack development.
