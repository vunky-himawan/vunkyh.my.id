## What’s the Hero Mission Here?

It’s called the Event Attendance System with Face Recognition, a campus project for a Computer Vision course that made me feel like Tony Stark—well, the Malang version with coffee and stress. The mission? Build an Android app that lets event participants check in using face recognition—no more manual work, all high-tech vibes. But honestly, the real mission was finishing the thing without losing my mind and getting a good grade. Spoiler: mission accomplished, with bonus drama and a bluescreening laptop!

## Secret Tech Arsenal

I pulled out every coding trick I had (and some I learned on the spot):

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python’s super-fast web framework. Used JWT for secure authentication.

- **Database**: SQL (can’t remember which ORM—trauma from debugging erased the memory).

- **Frontend**: Dart + Flutter for a slick Android app. Also used Next.js + Magic UI to demo the ML model after suddenly being told to implement a Siamese Network.

- **Machine Learning**: DeepFace for face recognition, plus trusty Python libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow. I also built a custom Siamese Network model.

- **Extras**: Google Colab Pro (my laptop gave up), Malang coffee, and prayers to stay sane.

## “Dear God, Where Did This Bug Come From?!”

The drama was wild. First, the ORM (whatever it was—maybe SQLAlchemy?) drove me nuts. Errors came from nowhere, and debugging felt like singing in the dark—not knowing what was wrong. Then my laptop bluescreened every time I tried to train the model with a big dataset. I even paid for Google Colab Pro, but it was still slow with only one core. And the cherry on top? One teammate completely bailed. Promised to handle backend—did absolutely nothing. I ended up doing it all: PM, full-stack dev, ML engineer, and even the final presentation. The fix? Late nights, coffee, silent rage, and sheer willpower.

## The “I Wanna Put This on a Billboard” Moment

The face recognition feature, hands down. I’m so proud—at first, the model was so bad it detected a table as a face (haunted much?). Thankfully, I used DeepFace’s pre-trained model, and everything ran smoothly. Integrating FastAPI, Flutter, and ML in one project felt like launching a rocket. The web-based demo using Next.js and Magic UI even predicted my friend’s face as a celebrity! That was the moment I thought, “Vunky, you genius.”

## Who Saw It and What They Said

VIP audience: classmates, the Computer Vision professor (who’s also the department head), and me—looking in the mirror saying “you madman, you did it.” During the demo, I forgot to set a threshold and the model misidentified a friend as a celeb—whole class burst into laughter. That broke the tension perfectly. Dream feedback? “This could be a startup!” (the professor just said “Good job,” but I’ll take it). His smile? That’s an A-grade smile.

## Medal of Honor

The biggest trophy: surviving as PM, full-stack dev, and ML engineer on a three-person team (with one ghost teammate). I’m proud of integrating FastAPI, Flutter, and DeepFace—it was my first real computer vision project. The grade? A, thank God. Plus I gained new skills: JWT, Siamese Networks, and skincare tips for sleep-deprived coders. My coffee expenses in Malang cafés went up 200%, but it was worth it.

## A Tale to Tell Over Coffee in Malang

Picture me at a café in Malang, telling a friend:
“Dude, I practically built this whole project myself. My teammate promised to do backend—did nothing! I coded the database, backend with FastAPI, Flutter app, and machine learning, while my laptop crashed every day. I stayed up, drank coffee, rage-coded—and finally, the demo worked. My friend’s face got mistaken for a celeb, everyone laughed. Moral of the story? Don’t trust sweet team promises—trust coffee!”

## Putting It on the Map

This project is up on GitHub—public, so the world can see the grind (and my confusing but functional code). Check it out at:

## Note

I’m not listing my team members here—those who know, know. But as PM, I took full responsibility to see this project through. Still, thanks to the team for being part of the journey in whatever way possible.
