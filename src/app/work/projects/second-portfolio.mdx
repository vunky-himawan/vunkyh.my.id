## The Superhero Mission

> “_I’m gonna build a portfolio site and look like a pro, bro!” — Vunky, dreaming big._"

Meet the **First Personal Portfolio**, a side hustle born from the burning desire to be a slick web developer in the early college days. The superhero mission? Craft a personal website to flex (barely existent) skills and dive into the Tailwind hype. No coursework, no competition, just pure Vunky vibes wanting to shine online. The result? A simple site hosted on GitHub Pages, feeling like I built the Eiffel Tower with my bare hands. And the cherry on top? I flexed the link on IG Stories like a tech influencer, haha!

## Secret Tech Weapons

My tech stack was rookie-level but full throttle:

- **HTML**: The backbone, like bricks for my digital cardboard palace.

- **CSS**: For making things look _lit_, though sometimes it was more like _lit my eyes on fire_ during debugging.

- **JavaScript**: For _fancy_ interactions, like scroll animations that made people go “ooh” (even if they lagged a bit).

- **Tailwind CSS**: A framework I loved and hated—easy to use but turned my HTML into a novel.

- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting that made me feel like a Silicon Valley startup bro.

## The “God, This Bug’s from Another Galaxy!” Moment

> "_Responsive? Is this a website or a wall mural?!” — Vunky, panicking at 3 a.m._"

The drama in this project was straight-up _Two Worlds_ comedy, no commercial breaks. I was a total web dev newbie—writing HTML like poetry, CSS had me yelling “why won’t this margin work?!”, and JavaScript was just `querySelector` and `addEventListener` for some basic scroll animations. Tailwind? Thought it was my savior, but it made my HTML look like a grocery list on steroids. The real chaos? Responsive design! I was clueless about making the site work on phones. Media queries? Flexbox? Felt like decoding alien hieroglyphs! When I tested on my phone, the site looked like a giant billboard—way too big, bro! Debugged till dawn, singing “Tailwind, please!”, only to realize I forgot `sm:`, `md:`, and their pals. I laughed my head off, muttering, “Vunky, you’re such a noob!”. Solution? Google, Malang coffee, and prayers that mobile browsers wouldn’t hate me.

## Masterpiece Worth Shouting About

> "_This isn’t just a website, it’s my digital Mona Lisa!” — Vunky, hyping on IG Stories._"

Simple as it was, I’m crazy proud of this site! The _masterpiece_ bits? Scroll animations that made sections pop like magic (even if they stuttered on old phones), a Tailwind-powered layout I thought was sleek AF, and a hero section that had me feeling like a pro designer. The content? Hero section, about, projects (just a “coming soon” placeholder), and a contact form that was pure aesthetic (it didn’t send anything, lol). Responsive design was a bit _iffy_, but for a Vunky just learning `div` and `flex`, this was like painting the Sistine Chapel with a marker. The ultimate flex? Sharing the link on IG Stories with a “My portfolio’s live, bro! 🚀” caption. Friends commented, “Dope, Vunk, but it’s kinda weird on my phone.” I just grinned, “That’s the _retro feature_, bro!”.

## Who Saw It and What’d They Say?

The audience was my Malang crew clicking the GitHub Pages link from my IG Stories, plus me, refreshing the site like a maniac. Friends’ reactions? “Whoa, Vunky, you got a website? Cool, but it’s kinda plain.” I shot back, “Plain? That’s _minimalist_, bro! Read some Medium!”. My dream? A recruiter stumbling on it and DMing, “Vunky, you’re hired!” (reality: just friends saying, “Add more colors!”). In my wildest fantasies, the site goes viral, and I’m keynoting at _Web Summit_, lol.

## Golden Trophy

> "_No grades, but I got skills and IG clout!” — Vunky, stoked despite being a newbie._"

Since this was a side project, no grades or lecturer pats on the back. But the golden trophy? I learned HTML, CSS, JS, and Tailwind from scratch, bro! From “what’s a `class`?” to hacking together a semi-responsive layout. Hosting on GitHub Pages made me feel like a _Matrix_ hacker. The real flex? My IG Stories post made me feel like a tech influencer, even if it got like 20 views, haha. Bonus: I became a regular at Malang cafés from all the late-night coding sessions.

## World Stage

The site’s still chilling on Cloudflare Pages, bro, like a monument to young Vunky’s hustle! The code’s super basic, but I set it public so the world can see my noob-era bravery. Check it at [Link to Cloudflare Pages](https://second.vunkyh.my.id/)

## Wrap-Up

This first portfolio was a teen comedy flick: HTML like a love letter, CSS that had me begging “margin, please work!”, JavaScript for some wannabe flair, and Tailwind stretching my code like a novel. The responsive struggle was real, but this was Vunky’s first step to web dev stardom. Big thanks to Malang, coffee, and IG Stories for making me feel like a tech rockstar. Vunky’s off to snooze, but the next project’s gotta be wilder, bro, so the world knows Vunky Himawan’s name!
