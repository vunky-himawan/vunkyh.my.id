title: "Cat Adoption System: CRUD, Chaos, and the Dream of an A"
publishedAt: "2023-12-24"
summary: "Cat Adoption System is a simple CRUD web app built for an Advanced Database course project. It uses Express.js + SQL Server for the backend and React for the frontend (learned on the go!). Despite the chaos of being a React newbie, the app worked—and scored an A. A dramatic but valuable experience!"

## The Big Dream?

This is the **Cat Adoption System**, a project from my _Advanced Database_ class that dropped like a ticking time bomb from the lecturer:

> “Make a CRUD project. Use whatever. Just make it work!”

The dream? Get it done, get an A, and maybe help some cute cats find their forever homes (well… virtually). This was a group project—powered heavily by Raihan’s “encouragement” (read: pressure)—that took me from total newbie to accidental developer. And yes, that big dream came true: **I got an A, bro!**

## The Weapons We Wielded

Even though my brain was still buffering, here’s what I used:

- **Backend**: Express.js for a speedy API, SQL Server as the database, and Knex.js as the ORM so the queries wouldn’t melt my brain.

- **Frontend**: React.js + Vite. At that point, I only knew `useState` and `useEffect`. Imagine a React noob taking on the world!

- **Extras**: Coffee, Raihan’s motivational threats, mobile legends with legends rank, and prayers that the code wouldn’t break.

## The “Astaghfirullah, What Is Happening?” Moment

Chaos started when Raihan—my overly enthusiastic friend—suddenly created both the frontend and backend repos and said:

> “Vunky, you take care of the frontend!”

Bro, I had just started learning React _two weeks ago_. I barely understood `useState`, never used `fetch`, and now I had to build the whole frontend. The result? A disaster.

One component had 10 `useStates`, props drilling like spider webs, and even I couldn’t read my own code. I opened my code and thought:

> “Who the heck wrote this mess?”
> Solution? Googling till dawn, asking Raihan, and praying. In the end, the code worked… barely. But hey—**it’s not stupid if it works**, right?

## Billboard-Worthy Moments

Let’s be honest: my code looked like a chaotic cat shelter. But I’m super proud of the journey. From barely understanding `useState` to building a full CRUD system with `fetch`—it’s like evolving from Magikarp to Gyarados.

The adoption feature was simple: users could add, edit, delete, and view adoptable cats. No fancy features, but for a React newbie like me, it was a real achievement.
I also learned about callbacks, `fetch`, and opened the door to a whole new world of frontend development.

## Who Saw It (and What They Said)

Main audience: my Advanced Database lecturer, Raihan (singing “Hurry up, Vunky!” every day), and classmates.
The lecturer even asked:

> “Can this system also take care of cats, like a cat hotel?”
> I laughed inside:
> “Sir, it’s just CRUD, not a startup pet service!”

My dream response came true when the lecturer said:

> “Vunky, what is this code? But hey—it’s good. A!”

Classmates?

> “Share the GitHub link, bro!”
> (Nope. Not happening, lol.)

## Medal of Honor

Biggest trophy? The glorious A that made my heart sing!
But beyond that, I gained a lot: `callbacks`, `fetch`, and the skill of surviving code chaos while half-conscious. This project was a stepping stone—transforming me from React baby to someone who kinda knows what’s going on.

## Story for the Grandkids

> “Kid, your father once made this cat adoption system like it was nothing. Coffee, gaming, chats with friends… totally chill.

> One week before the deadline, I barely slept. The night before the presentation? Didn’t sleep at all.

> The code was a mess, but that A? It landed right in my gradebook.
> Moral of the story?

> Don’t chill like your dad. But if you're in deep trouble, coffee and prayer are your best friends.”

## Showcase to the Universe

The project is live on GitHub—_public_, so the world can witness my struggle (and the spaghetti code).

## Closing Words

This Cat Adoption System felt like a comedy drama: from Raihan’s pressure, chaotic components with 10 `useStates`, to all-nighters for an A. Despite the mess, this project made me fall in love with React, learn `fetch`, and realize that coding is just like caring for cats: it can be chaotic, but you’ll end up loving the process.

**Thanks to Raihan, coffee, and imaginary cats for helping me pass Advanced Databases!**
Next project? Hopefully something that makes me laugh _and sleep_, for once.
