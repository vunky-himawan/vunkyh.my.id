summary: "The Campus Inventory System was a semester 3 group project to manage campus inventory using PHP native and Bootstrap 5. Despite heroic efforts with a shaky team and tech that fought back, the final demo crashed and burned when one feature failed in front of a killer lecturer. Grades tanked, but the lessons learned and late-night coffee runs were the real MVPs!"

## The Grand Dream That Crashed

> “We’re gonna be Iron Man, building a slick inventory app for campus!” — Our naive dreams, RIP."

Meet the **Campus Inventory System**, a semester 3 group project for a course that made us feel like Iron Man, but with a dying Arc Reactor. The grand dream? Build a web app to track campus inventory, so lecturers wouldn’t lose their minds hunting for projectors or markers. Reality? The final demo was a heart-pounding disaster in front of a lecturer with a death stare, one feature refused to work, grades went kaput, and we could only drown our sorrows in Malang’s finest coffee.

## Tech Arsenal That (Tried to) Save the Day

We rolled out some old-school tech, ‘cause we were total noobs:

- **Backend**: PHP native, no framework, like building a skyscraper with a spoon. Every line of code felt like a leap of faith.

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. Our lecturer banned Tailwind, so we were stuck with Bootstrap, which was as customizable as a brick wall.

- **Extras**: Figma (our teammate’s slick design that made me cry trying to implement), Malang coffee, and prayers that the lecturer wouldn’t roast us too hard.

## The “God, Why Is It Breaking During Demo?!” Moment

> "Error? Now?! In front of the killer lecturer?!” — My soul, screaming internally."

This project was a horror flick, bro. I barely knew PHP—couldn’t tell `$_POST` from `$_GET`, let alone build a CRUD with PHP native. Bootstrap 5? Made me wanna scream, “Responsive design is a myth!”. Customizing Bootstrap was like solving a Rubik’s cube blindfolded, and turning our teammate’s Figma design into reality felt like singing opera off-key. The ultimate nightmare? During the demo, with the killer lecturer’s eyes burning holes through us, one feature—maybe the input form or stock report—just died. The screen froze, the room went silent, and the lecturer’s sigh was louder than a foghorn. I stood there like a statue, thinking, “Time to flee to a Malang café!”. Fix? Nada, bro, we just surrendered and braced for the grade apocalypse.

## The (Almost) Masterpiece

> "It’s not a failure, it’s… character building!” — Me, coping hard."

Honestly, this project was like a shipwreck before it even sailed, haha! But if I squint, I’m proud of our guts. Four of us (out of six, two were “you know who”) dared to tackle a complex system with PHP native. We planned crazy features: inventory CRUD, stock reports, even an admin dashboard. Reality? Only the login form kinda worked, and even that was buggy. Still, slogging through PHP and Bootstrap was like running a marathon in flip-flops—didn’t win, but we crossed the finish line!

## Who Witnessed This Epic Fail?

The audience for this trainwreck: our classmates, the killer lecturer, and us, trying not to pass out from stress. The demo room was tenser than a horror movie climax—nobody dared breathe, let alone laugh, under the lecturer’s death-ray stare. When the feature crashed, the lecturer’s sigh was a sonic boom, basically saying, “Vunky, what even is this?”. Classmates just exchanged pity glances, whispering, “RIP our grades”. My dream reaction? The lecturer saying, “No worries, you learned something!” (but nah, that glare was a life sentence). In my wildest fantasies, my friends would’ve said, “Vunky, you’re still a rockstar, even if this app’s a digital dumpster fire!”.

## Consolation Prize

> "Grades? Who needs ‘em when you’ve got coffee and stories?” — My mantra post-demo."

Prize? Our grades crashed harder than a Windows 95 PC, bro. That semester’s GPA was a Shakespearean tragedy. But the consolation prize? Wisdom for the ages: PHP native is like trying to tame a wild boar, Bootstrap is the enemy of responsive dreams, and a flaky team is a one-way ticket to chaos. I learned the basics of PHP debugging (mostly yelling “where’s the error?!”) and realized frameworks are the holy grail (Laravel, where were you?). Plus, this nerve-wracking demo became a legendary tale for Malang coffee shop gossip sessions.

## Coffee Shop Tale in Malang

Picture me spilling the beans at a Malang café: “Bro, this inventory project made me wanna ditch coding for goat herding. Four of us, two freeloaders, building an app with PHP native that threw errors like a tantrum. Bootstrap? Responsive was a cruel joke. Demo day? One feature died, the killer lecturer’s glare could’ve vaporized us, and the room was deader than my grades. We slunk back, sang the blues, and chugged coffee. Moral? Never use PHP native if your brain’s still rocking a 56K modem!”.

## Monument to the Madness

There’s a GitHub repo, bro, but it’s like the ruins of a lost empire—I’m too embarrassed to flaunt it! The code’s a chaotic mess, but I made it _public_ so the world can marvel at my bravery (and my spectacular flop). Check it at [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/raihanachmad8/inventory-jti.git)

## Wrap-Up

The Campus Inventory System was a horror flick with no laughs: PHP native that fried my neurons, Bootstrap that mocked responsive design, a “you know who” team, and a demo so tense it felt like facing a dragon. Grades tanked, but I learned coding’s like stand-up comedy: sometimes you bomb, but you keep performing. Shoutout to Malang, coffee, and the killer lecturer for forging my steel nerves. Vunky’s off to snooze, but the next project better be a banger, bro, so I’m not just the king of demo disasters!
