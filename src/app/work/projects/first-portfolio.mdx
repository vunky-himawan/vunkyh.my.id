## What‚Äôs the Epic Dream?

> ‚Äú_I‚Äôm dropping a next-level portfolio to show off my React skills, bro!‚Äù ‚Äî Vunky, fueled by ambition._"

Meet the **Second Personal Portfolio**, a passion project sparked by the urge to flex newly minted React skills and jump on the Astro bandwagon after spotting it in campus community group chats. The epic dream? Craft a portfolio site that‚Äôs leagues beyond the first, using modern tech to prove Vunky‚Äôs no rookie web dev. The result? A _sleek_ site hosted on GitHub Pages, rocking a _minimalist_ design (not plain, okay?), and instantly flexed on IG Stories like a Malang tech influencer!

## Secret Tech Arsenal

The tech stack leveled up, but still pure Vunky vibes:

- **Astro**: A blazing-fast static site framework that made me feel like a cutting-edge dev.

- **React**: For slick interactive components, even if I was still shaky on hooks.

- **UnoCSS**: A leaner Tailwind alternative, though it still stretched my HTML into a novel.

- **Framer Motion**: For fancy animations like a marquee, which drove me half-crazy.

- **Cloudflare Pages**: Free hosting that had me feeling like a no-budget startup mogul.

## The ‚ÄúGod, Why Is This Breaking?!‚Äù Moment

> "_`client:visible` props, why you betray me?! Why‚Äôs the marquee stuck?!‚Äù ‚Äî Vunky, singing the blues at 4 a.m._"

The drama here was peak teen comedy with a twist. I was a React newbie, barely grasping `useState` vs `useEffect`, and Astro‚Äôs props system had me shook. Biggest headache? Astro directives like `client:visible` and its crew. I botched the props, and the site rendered‚Ä¶ nothing! Debugged till dawn, only to realize I skipped the Astro docs on _client-side hydration_. Round two? The Framer Motion marquee animation. Thought it‚Äôd be a breeze‚Äîjust slap a `motion.div` and slide. Nope! It froze like a broken escalator, and I was whining, ‚ÄúFramer, do your job!‚Äù. Fix? Finally read the docs, leaned on Google, and chugged Malang coffee till my wallet cried. The marquee eventually slid, though it was a bit _wobbly_.

## Masterpiece Worth Flexing

> "_This isn‚Äôt a portfolio, it‚Äôs my minimalist manifesto!‚Äù ‚Äî Vunky, hyping on IG Stories._"

I‚Äôm stupid proud of the _minimalist_ UI (not plain, bro, it‚Äôs art!). The hero section‚Äôs _clean_, the projects section has a Framer Motion marquee that screams ‚Äúwow!‚Äù, and the UnoCSS layout is _sleek_ as heck. Content? Hero, about, projects (actually listing stuff now, not just ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù), and a contact form that‚Äôs still _aesthetic_ (but, uh, doesn‚Äôt send anything, lol). Astro‚Äôs performance made the site zippy, like a drag racer on Cloudflare Pages. The ultimate flex? Posted it on IG Stories with a ‚ÄúNew portfolio live, bro! üî•‚Äù caption. Friends commented, ‚ÄúVunky, this is _clean_!‚Äù. I just grinned, ‚ÄúTold ya, _minimalist_ is king!‚Äù.

## Who Saw It and What‚Äôd They Say?

Main audience: my IG followers who clicked the Stories link, plus random netizens stumbling on the GitHub Pages URL. Friends‚Äô reactions? ‚ÄúVunk, your site‚Äôs dope! So _clean_!‚Äù. Some noticed, ‚ÄúUh, the contact form‚Äôs fake, right?‚Äù. I smirked, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the _zen_ feature, bro, for inner peace!‚Äù. My dream? A startup recruiter DMing, ‚ÄúVunky, join us!‚Äù (reality: just friends saying, ‚ÄúMaybe add some colors so it‚Äôs less _minimalist_‚Äù). In my wildest dreams, the site lands on _Product Hunt_, and I‚Äôm trending on Twitter, lol.

## Golden Trophy

> "_No trophy, but I‚Äôm hyped as heck, bro!‚Äù ‚Äî Vunky, heart doing a Gangnam Style dance._"

Since it‚Äôs a side project, no grades or lecturer high-fives. But the golden trophy? Pure satisfaction crafting a portfolio that‚Äôs so _Vunky_! I learned Astro from scratch, wrestled with hydration and props (post-drama), and got comfy with React. UnoCSS saved time compared to Tailwind, and Framer Motion taught me animation basics, making me feel like a motion design pro. Bonus? The IG Stories flex made me a Malang micro-influencer, and local caf√©s got rich from my late-night coding binges!

## World Stage

The site‚Äôs still chilling on GitHub Pages, bro, like a monument to young Vunky‚Äôs hustle! The code‚Äôs super basic, but I set it public so the world can see my noob-era bravery. Check it at [Link to GitHub Pages](https://vunky-himawan.github.io/first-portfolio/)

## Wrap-Up

This first portfolio was a teen comedy flick: HTML like a love letter, CSS that had me begging ‚Äúmargin, please work!‚Äù, JavaScript for some wannabe flair, and Tailwind stretching my code like a novel. The responsive struggle was real, but this was Vunky‚Äôs first step to web dev stardom. Big thanks to Malang, coffee, and IG Stories for making me feel like a tech rockstar. Vunky‚Äôs off to snooze, but the next project‚Äôs gotta be wilder, bro, so the world knows Vunky Himawan‚Äôs name!
