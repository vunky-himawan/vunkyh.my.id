## About the Project

The Hidden Gem Promotion System is a web platform designed to help promote lesser-known tourist destinations and local MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises). The main goal of this project is to make it easier for tourism or business owners to introduce their places to a wider audience, while also giving travelers who love to discover "hidden gems" an easy way to find unique destinations. This project was developed as part of a competition and successfully ranked 6th out of more than 20 participants.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using modern technologies to ensure optimal performance and user experience:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript, providing a responsive interface and fast development with strong type safety.
- **Backend**: NestJS, a powerful Node.js framework for building scalable and well-structured APIs.
- **Text Editor**: Tiptap, used to build a custom text editor that supports interactive article features.

## Key Features

One of the most exciting aspects of this project is the set of interactive features that allow users to:

- Read, like, and comment on articles about tourist destinations.
- Reply to comments to spark more lively discussions.
- Use a custom-built Tiptap-based text editor I designed, offering a flexible and intuitive writing experience.
- Plan trips together through a Group Traveling feature.

These features were designed to increase user engagement—both from the perspective of tourism owners who want to share their stories and travelers who want to interact with the content.

## Challenges

As my first complex web project, the main challenge was building interactive features like the like system, comments, and threaded replies from scratch. While there were no major technical blockers, time pressure was a real test. A few days before the deadline, the competition committee suddenly required all projects to be deployed, which pushed my team and me to rush through the deployment process.

The frontend deployed on Vercel often failed due to suboptimal configuration, and the backend deployed on a VPS faced similar issues.

## Impact and Results

Despite being completed under time pressure—with a final push during the last few days before submission—the result was very satisfying. The platform managed to catch the judges' attention and placed 6th out of over 20 competition entries. With better preparation, I’m confident this project could have achieved an even higher ranking. It also proved that hard work during crunch time can produce something truly meaningful.

## Target Users

This platform is designed for two main audiences:

- **Local MSME or hidden destination owners**: They can promote their place or products through engaging and interactive articles.
- **Adventurous travelers**: Users who enjoy exploring new destinations and seeking unique experiences beyond mainstream tourist spots.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me a lot—from technical aspects like deployment configuration to time management. A funny story behind this project is how I procrastinated at first but then went all-in during the final days. Ironically, that’s when I learned the most: dedication and focus can turn things around. This experience also boosted my confidence in building complex web applications.

## Project Access

The project is available as a public repository on GitHub, allowing anyone to view the code and contribute:

## Closing

The Hidden Gem Promotion System has been a journey full of challenges and rewarding moments. From building interactive features to fighting against deployment deadlines, this project is a testament to how persistence and creativity can lead to meaningful results. I'm proud of what we've achieved and excited to continue developing similar projects in the future.
