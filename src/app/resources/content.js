        I'm a full-stack web developer with a knack for TypeScript, crafting
        responsive UIs using React/Next.js and TailwindCSS, and building robust
        APIs with NestJS and ExpressJS. Iâ€™ve dipped my toes into mobile
        development and machine learning, but my curiosity for tech runs
        deepâ€”always wondering why things work and how to make them better. Iâ€™m
        constantly exploring new tools, ideas, and solutions, driven by a
        passion for creating efficient, scalable, and user-focused digital
        experiences. My journey? Itâ€™s just getting started!
