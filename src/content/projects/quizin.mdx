## Overview

Quizin is a simple quiz application that allows users to take and view quiz results. Quizin uses API from Open Trivia DB. Quizin is a challenge given by DOT Indonesia to fulfill the internship requirements in creating a quiz application using React.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using their username and password.
- **Doing Quiz**: Users can take a quiz and view the results.
- **Quiz Results**: Users can view their quiz.
- **Memoization**: If the user suddenly closes the browser the quiz data will still be saved and when the user returns it can immediately resume the previous quiz.

## Challenges

- **User authentication:** Because this is my full stack application where previously I was only a front end, in this project I tried to work as a full stack developer so user authentication is a challenge that I think is quite difficult because this feature involves the access rights of each user.

## Learning Outcomes

In this project, I learned about how to use the API that I built myself using expressjs, and I learned to use the database ORM, drizzle orm.
